Hello, this file contains the instructions for running the Recipe App. It covers everything from downloading the base Java files to the software and libraries needed to fully run the application. 

The GitHub repo for the project can be found at https://github.com/ucsd-cse110-fa23/cse-110-project-team-16.

## Step 1: Downloading the base code

Please go to our GitHub project repo. Once there, please go to the branch titled **MS2-Demo**. This contains all the base Java code for the program. Please download it to your machine (whilst **preserving the file structure**).

## Step 2: Getting the necessary software

Before we can actually run the program, several piece of software is required:

- JDK version 17 (or higher). Download here from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- Visual Studio Code (in theory Eclipse also works but VScode worked the best from our experiences). Download here from [Microsoft](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- JavaFX 21. Download [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)

>Please get the versions that matches your machine's OS/platform
